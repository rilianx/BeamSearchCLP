File desctiption
=================

BSG-CLP			: The executable 64-bit version of BSG-CLP (compiled with c++ on ubuntu linux)
BSG-tests.ods 	: open-office file with the results of the experiments
data.tar.gz		: files with all the instance sets
outputs.tar.gz	: files with the output of our BSG-CLP algorithm (on CLP and CLP-FS instances). Include all the found solutions.



Algorithm execution
--------------------

./BSG-CLP <instance_set> <initial_instance> <final_instance> <min_fr> <CLP_type> <time> <output_solution>

initial_instance	(0-99) first instance to be solved in the set.

final_instance	(initial_instance-99) last instance to be solved in the set.

min_fr:				minimum used volume of a block (typical values: 0.98, 1.0). This parameter is required 
					by the GeneralBlockGeneration method.

CLP_type:			0 - without full support
					1 - with fulls support
			
output_solution		no - the founded solutions are not saved
					file - the founded solutions are saved as file-i.txt, where i is the number of the instance
					
Examples of execution:

./CLP ../data/BR0.txt 0 99 0 1.0 0 500 no  %(the complete instance set 0 is solved, 500 seconds per instance)
./CLP ../data/BR0.txt 20 20 1.0 0 500 inst   %(only the instance 20 of the instance set 0 is solved)
./CLP ../data/BR4.txt 0 99 0 1.0 1 500 no  %(the complete instance set 4 is solved with the full support constraint)
